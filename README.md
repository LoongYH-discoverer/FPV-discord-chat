# FPV-discord-chat
found out that we have vr chat , and discord  howbout both combine bruh
_________
SO, I have an idea of making a low resolution first-person-view-chat-socialmedia (or third or top view).
have fun in interacting animation with friends, maybe support face emotion capture.
Must be super smooth when online, so lets just ignore Graphic this thing.
hold up to 10 member in begining of this project.
Minecraft level of freedom. Sims level of customizability. Yup. and Tombraider 1996 style of graphic(just enough to recognise player face they upload)
_________
//What in my mind: while mco friends can play in chat room, chat, or text, or magic pop out some random meme to talk about. While others just sit on a potato (literally a potato ) coach and wacth tv(share screen).They pop their mouth when player talk just like popcat.
 
 Update nvrmind, Mark zugburger just released meta idea.
